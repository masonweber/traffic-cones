The aim of this project is to get a python treaded project running to handle traffic at an intersection, starting with a 4-way stop.
This should allow an exploration of queues, stacks, heaps, timing.

At random interval (1-5 seconds) a car arrives up in one of the 4 directions with a random turn direction (L, S, R).
When the intersection is clear, cars may enter following the right of way and direction based no who just exited the intersection.
Up to two vehicles that can travel thru the intersection at once will. Not allowing all four to turn right, for instance.
